# Learn-JSL
My full tensorflow object detection project regarding the Japan Sign Language alphabet. Collected my own test and train dataset, and installed
tensorflow object detection API to train using Google colab. To make the implementation easier and intuitive, I created separate models for each set of
Japanese characters (such as あ〜お) and implemented each in the html files shown.
